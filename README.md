Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency and asset that operates on a network of nodes, leveraging cryptography to secure transactions and enable trustless exchanges in a 
free market environment. There is a lot to unpack, and while we’re only touching on certain aspects, it is crucial to understand why it’s important to know and discuss Bitcoin. 
Studying and discussing Bitcoin is crucial because it represents a revolutionary shift in the financial system, offering an alternative to traditional currencies and banking systems. Understanding Bitcoin helps investors, policymakers, and individuals navigate its potential as a store of value, its volatility, and its impact on global economics and digital innovation.

## Bitcoin vs Traditional Assets


      In this part of the project, demonstrating the potential of investing in Bitcoin required a comparison with traditional assets like the S&P 500 and Gold. Particularly comparing the returns, risks and general trends.

This graph here clearly shows the following things :
      
1. S&P 500 Stability: The red line (S&P 500 returns) shows consistent, low-volatility monthly returns, indicating steady performance over time.

2. Bitcoin Volatility: The blue line (Bitcoin returns) demonstrates sharp and frequent fluctuations, highlighting its significantly higher volatility compared to the S&P 500

This graph displays the cumulative value of Bitcoin, the S&P 500, and Gold, providing the following insights:

1. Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin shows the highest cumulative returns, significantly outperforming other assets.
2. Volatility Differences: Crude Oil had volatile early movements, recovering modestly.
3. Steady Performers: S&P 500 and Gold maintained relatively stable and moderate returns.
4. Diversification Insight: Bitcoin offers high growth but comes with higher volatility compared to traditional assets.
